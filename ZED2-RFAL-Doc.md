# Working with the ZED 2

Stereo camera designed for robotics applications - to be used as a part of the BlueROV underwater vehicle. Using USB 3.0. The technology is entirely passive (no IR lighting or Time of flight)

##### ZED SDK - ROS Integration

**Running the ZED ROS Node**

Don't close until you're done with your ZED!

```
roslaunch zed_wrapper zed2.launch
```

To launch a zed2 with the rviz displaying the camera information

```
roslaunch zed_display_rviz display_zed2.launch
```

**Onboard Image Signal Processing vs. Host Computer**

See below for more information about the ISP. The Host Computer is the computer that the ZED is directly attached to via USB, and much of the impressive features of ZED require the host to calculate.  

 > The ZED camera **features an onboard ISP (Image Signal Processor) that performs various image processing algorithms on raw images** captured by dual image sensors. Several parameters of the ISP can be adjusted directly ... through the ZED SDK

These can be adjusted or configured on initialization.

**ZED Open Capture API and Low-Level Camera and Sensor Capture**

An open-source C++ library for low-level capture of camera and sensor data (raw video frames, calibration data, camera controls, and raw data from camera sensors) is made available by stereolabs, and can be run on a host computer without CUDA. 

Synchronization mechanism is available to match data with a given video frame. The ZED SDK output data is calibrated and compensated, while here extracted raw data is not corrected by camera and sensor calibration parameters. 

Prereqs: Linux OS, GCC (v7.5+), CMake (v3.1+). Optional for examples: OpenCV (v3.4.0+)

Get video and sensor data 

```C++
#include "videocapture.hpp"
sl_oc::video::VideoCapture cap;
cap.initializeVideo();
const sl_oc::video::Frame frame = cap.getLastFrame();

#include "sensorcapture.hpp"
sl_oc::sensors::SensorCapture sens;
std::vector<int> devs = sens.getDeviceList();
sens.initializeSensors( devs[0] );
const sl_oc::sensors::data::Imu imuData = sens.getLastIMUData(5000);
const sl_oc::sensors::data::Magnetometer magData = sens.getLastMagnetometerData(100);
const sl_oc::sensors::data::Environment envData = sens.getLastEnvironmentData(100);
const sl_oc::sensors::data::Temperature tempData = sens.getLastCameraTemperatureData(100);
```

##### Calibration

**Camera Calibration Parameters through API**

Manual calibration is not recommended for ZED2 cameras as output could be degraded from factory calibration. (If you are using for in in-air application! Underwater - it's pretty essential)

Using the API you can retrieve many of the camera calibration parameters. 
```python
calibration_params = zed.get_camera_information().camera_configuration.calibration_parameters

# Focal length of the left eye in pixels
focal_left_x = calibration_params.left_cam.fx

# First radial distortion coefficient
k1 = calibration_params.left_cam.disto[0]

# Translation between left and right eye on z-axis
tz = calibration_params.T.z

# Horizontal field of view of the left eye in degrees
h_fov = calibration_params.left_cam.h_fov
```
Focal length - fx, fy
Principal points - cx, cy
Lens distortion - k1, k2, k3, p1, p2
Horizontal, vertical, and diagonal FOV
Stereo calibration: rotation and translation between left and right eye

**Underwater Calibration** 

 > The ZED cameras are air calibrated, and as water acts as a lens, you will need to re-calibrate your camera in order to use it underwater. 
 > 
 > You can use the ZED Calibration tool if you have a setup that allows you to use a display underwater [no, I don't think we do], otherwise, you must use an external library like OpenCV and a water-resistant chessboard. 
 > Note that the ZED cameras are not water-resistant...
